## As a user I want to have a unique login so my account is safe from otherâ€™s logging in
* There should be a box for user to enter username and password
* There should be a button for logging in
* Given the user navigated to the login page
* When the user enter a valid username and password
* Then the user should be navigated to the home page
* When the user enter a invalid username and password
* Then the system should decline the login action
