## Meeting 1 decisions:
- Have testing fixed and code coverage increased (done by Emma and Sarah). Sarah will do channels and messages tests and emma will do the others
- Finish writing functions and making the code work by Monday (Andy and Kaiqi)
- Have this done by monday so for the next week, so that for the last week of the iteration we can all be focusing on changing the code to fit with software design engineering principles 
 
## Reflection should include:
* How often you met and why
* Details on how people worked on the same code
* What you did when things didnâ€™t go to plan
* What methods were used to ensure meetings were successful

Our team SAKE has worked through the third iteration to alter the tests to increase coverage and adapt to changes in the function specifications. Using our knowledge from the course we implemented software engineering design principles to create better code. 

To ensure we shared mutual understanding of what we would be working on and how much we had achieved, our group communicated digitally and scheduled meetings approximately three times a week. These meetings lasted from an hour to two hours and were made successful using standups. The use of standups ensured each team member knew what needed to be achieved and could receive advice or help from other members. Furthermore through using the taskboard on git and regularly committing our changes to files, we kept up to date with each others work. 

For iteration 3, the project mostly followed the plan. The team met on Thursday about a fortnight before the due date and discussed the allocation of tasks and deadlines. We decided to complete the tests and implement the new functions by the next meeting (Monday). If we could not complete a task during this meeting which was in our lab, we could work together using pair programming to fix the problem. The use of pair programming also enabled us to share our knowledge about different parts of the code we wrote the other team members may not have been aware of. Fortunately, by Monday the original deadline we were able to complete our set tasks. Therefore we could spend the final week implementing the software design engineering principles into our code and make minor bug fixes. 

In order to work on the same code we branched off master into a branch called tests for iteration 3. The branch server was from iteration 2 and was merged into tests so we could separate our code from each iteration. Furthermore, in iteration 1 we assigned each other different files to work on, yet in iteration 2 we worked on the same files. We found it was easier to reduce merge conflicts and the amount of pulls if we worked on separate files. Also rather than trying to solve problems on the files, we communicated when we needed help from each other for a specific problem. 

For iteration three we successfully learned from iteration one and two and set deadlines for larger parts of the iteration earlier. This allowed more time to focus on detail and final touches without added stress. Finishing earlier also allowed for time to solve any merge conflicts and ensure everything was properly merged to our master branch.  Furthermore, rather than merging to master once we completed all the code, once we finished each file we merged to master. This reduced the amount of merge conflicts for the final step and lessened the probability of last minute issues with merging.
