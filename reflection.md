# Group Reflection:

The first iteration has seen our group, SAKE, work through the initial phases of 
the slackr assignment and plan ahead for the implementation phase. 
Overall these first two weeks have been successful and the group has worked closely together to produce thorough tests.

An important aspect of the completion of iteration 1 has involved frequent team
meetings to allow for thorough communication. At a minimum, the group has been 
meeting regularly on Fridays and Mondays during our lab times. When need be, we 
have also been meeting on Tuesdays. At these meetings we begin with a quick 
standup to catch each other up. If we cannot meet in person, we have also been 
completing asynchronous standups in group messages. An example of what is discussed 
in these standups includes:

Date: 4th October:

|Member|Done|To-Do|
|------|----|-----|
|Emma|Wrote user stories, began reflection|Finish pytests, begin to write assumptions, plan and reflection|
|Sarah|Completed four pytests, began writing up the reflection|Finish pytests, work on assumptions and plan|
|Andy|Completed four pytests for user functions|Finish pytest, work on assumptions, plan|
|Kaiqi|Completed pytest for most functions|Finish up the tests and user stories|


Our group allocated the completion of the pytests among team members with an 
aim of equally allocating responsibilities. Alongside this we sought to group the
pytests completed by each member following the epics we outlined in our user stories.
As part of allocating tasks, we used the issues feature on gitlab to assign functions
to each member, but also so each member could see what needed to be finished and 
what was already done. In this way, if a member is struggling or has already
completed their work they can help others. 

We have been working through making decisions by group discussions and using
majority consensus to overcome any disagreements in regards to how to move 
forward with an issue. An example of an issue we have resolved includes when 
there were conflicting ideas on how to approach the version control aspect of our
assignment and we needed to discuss the desired method in keeping our branches 
clean and updated. 

Moving forward to the second iteration we have identified that we need to continue 
to communicate and meet more regularly. We also aim to push more regularly to git 
and when doing so, write better commit messages. Finally for this next iteration 
we are aiming to start writing our code earlier to ensure the final stages of 
merging are easier and completed with less time pressure.
